# Stranded Bartender (ARCHIVE)

A short interactive 3D experience made in Unity. Take control of an isometric player controller, explore a fully 3D island for your cocktail ingredients, and then make your cocktail using the mouse.

Made in ~2 months for a university assignment submission, as part of the "Principles of 3D' module at UWE Bristol (BSc Games Technology).
